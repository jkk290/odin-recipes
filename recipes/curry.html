        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people.</p>
